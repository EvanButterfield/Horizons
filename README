This is the game New Horizons by Evan Butterfield.

In order to build (Windows only right now), you need to run "vcvarsall.bat x64"
This will add the Visual C Compiler and other related tools to the path so
that the build scripts can run and compile the code

MAKE SURE TO RUN ONE OF THE SHADER BUILD SCRIPTS BEFORE YOU RUN
